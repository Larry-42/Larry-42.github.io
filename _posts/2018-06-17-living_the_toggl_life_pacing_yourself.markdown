One of the biggest issues with a self-paced course like Flatiron's online program is, well, pacing.  If you push yourself too hard (particularly if you have a full-time job), you burn out.  And if you don't push hard enough, you don't progress.  Sometimes, it's hard to tell objectively whether you're pushing yourself too hard, too little, or just enough.  The only way to know for sure how much you're working is to use a timing app to figure out how much time you're actually spending on code.  Well, OK, you could use a stopwatch or something like that, but timing apps are easier to use, not to mention cooler and more fun.

I'm partial to Toggl, but there are [many other apps](https://blog.hubstaff.com/toggl-alternatives/) out there.  When I started using Toggl, I was a bit surprised--I was spending much less time on my coding than I'd thought, and making relatively little progress.  This was a wake-up call which led me to increase my efforts.  I still didn't up my hours to where I thought that they'd be, but at least I was able to be honest with myself and make the progress on the course which I should have.  And, really, we only get 168 hours in a week--you have to decide for yourself how many of them should go to code.

TL;DR--Don't just estimate how much time you're spending coding--use a timing app.  The results might surprise you!
