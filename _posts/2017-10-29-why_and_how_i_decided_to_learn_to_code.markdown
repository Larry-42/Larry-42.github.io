Why do I want to learn to code?  And what am I doing at Flatiron's online program, of all places?

Well, I have always enjoyed programming as far back as I can remember.  When I was young and people asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I'd say "A computer programmer!" without hesitation. However, back in the early 2000's, when the .com crash and a major wave of outsourcing loomed large, I decided against pursuing a software career.  Instead I chose a career in a different field of engineering. Even so, I've always ended up doing whatever light scripting was needed in all of my jobs and acted as the resident computer whisperer as required.

A while back, I started seeing that programming jobs were in demand again, and remembered how much I'd enjoyed programming over the years.  Then I realized that all the tools I needed to start learning programming were available online, for little to no money.  Nothing was stopping me from learning to program.  I went through a few introductory courses--various little things on Codeacademy, CS50x, and so on.  Programming was just as enjoyable as I'd remembered.  But after a while I felt like I was just doing beginner tutorials over and over again; I was spinning my wheels rather than improving my programming ability.

So, I looked into what my logical next steps were, and I realized that I could spend months to years self-teaching, or go to a bootcamp for the guided tour.  Eventually, I realized that I wasn't ready to quit my job to spend 90 hours a week learning to code, and that online part time bootcamps were a thing.  I decided on Flatiron's online program because their on-site program had a decent reputation. I also liked that the online program is self-paced, which fits well with my sometimes erratic schedule.  Well, here I am--I'll let you all know how it goes.
